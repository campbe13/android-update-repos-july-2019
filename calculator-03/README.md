# Calculator v 3

This is my solution for the simple Calculator exercise, with the
* added code xml for styles
* added code to retain the state of the result displayed on the screen
* added Logging of the two state methods & the result
* added an image to the bottom of the calculator

result is in a TextView so it is the programmer's responsibility to save
and restore it as needed

override 
onSaveInstanceState()
and
onRestoreInstanceState()
