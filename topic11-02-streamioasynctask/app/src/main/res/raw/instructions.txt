 To run this code on an AVD:

 1 create a small file:
    a. shell into the device  adb shell
    b. ls / >  /sdcard/ascii.txt
    c. run the app
    d. watch the log adb logcat -s MTHREAD
    note that the I/O will probably finish before you can page through any of it

 2 create a large file:
   a. shell into the device  adb sh
   b. ls -lR / >  /sdcard/ascii.txt
   c. run the app
   d. watch the log adb logcat -s MTHREAD
   note that the I/O will probably continue in the background
   as you are paging through the file
