/*
 * This code is an example of doing I/O in a background thread
 * using AsyncTask
 * remember AsyncTask is good for fairly short running tasks
 * anything long running Java Threads are better.
 * 
 *  The I/O done here is to read a file from the Android SD card
 *  path: /sdcard/ 
 *  
 *  To run this code: 
 *  
 *  1 create a small file: 
 *  a. shell into the device  adb shell
 *  b. ls / >  /sdcard/ascii.txt
 *  c. run the app
 *  d. watch the log adb logcat -s MTHREAD
 *  note that the I/O will probably finish before you can page through any of it
 *  
 *  2 create a large file: 
 *  a. shell into the device  adb shell
 *  b. ls -lR / >  /sdcard/ascii.txt
 *  c. run the app
 *  d. watch the log adb logcat -s MTHREAD
 *  note that the I/O will probably continue in the background 
 *  as you are paging through the file 
 *
