# Responding to Implicit Intents
using  intent-filters  
## BestWebBrowser
On launch this app  will load a website in a WebView.  

It has intent filters that will have it respond to  Action View and data uris of http & https.


If you have a default browser you will not see a list to select browsers, so if you want to
test this remove your default.

NOTE:   WebView not installed on all distros, may be unable to  use WebKit
I am working on a solution
